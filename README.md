# deploy-changed-code
Helping me to deploy changed code to the server.

It is useful if you love to use a text editor (e.g. Atom, Sublime Text, etc.) to do coding and you don't want to use vi to modify your code on the remote server.

## Notice ##
1. It is made for Python 2.7.
2. You have to stage your files on the local git repository before running this script.
